			<p>Jeb Putzier knows how he got here, sitting on his couch on a recent Tuesday morning, his hair disheveled and his daily regimen of therapy and supplements scribbled on a calendar on the kitchen table. His thoughts can often be muddled, but some replays remain vivid.</p>
			<p>He remembers&nbsp;the brutal blow delivered by New England cornerback Asante Samuel in 2005 that left him with six stitches and a jaw that still pops out. Putzier&nbsp;remembers&nbsp;the crushing hit by San Diego linebacker Steve Foley later that season that is still floating around the internet titled &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/EwKlBo4O0Ds"><em>Steve Foley almost kills Jeb Putzier</em></a>.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Putzier&nbsp;remembers his release from the Broncos seven years ago, and he certainly remembers the steep drop that followed: his suicide attempt and an acrimonious end to his marriage that limits visitations with his two young children to once every few weeks.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;My kids. If my kids weren&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d already be dead.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>After suffering what he estimates were more than 1,000 concussions, as well as an array of physical injuries during his eight-year professional career, seven of those in the NFL, Putzier now spends his time searching for ways to clear his mind and end his pain. His joints ache. His head hurts. And although his injuries are far from debilitating, his mind is constantly in overdrive, causing otherwise routine activities to exhaust him.</p>
			<div class="centerphoto">
				<img src="./img/JEB_01.jpg" alt="Jeb Putzier rummages through a closet" />
				<p class="caption"><span class="photog">AAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post</span>Jeb Putzier rummages through a small closet in his basement where he keeps mementos from his playing days. Though in a physical state that has him feeling like he is 75 years old, Putzier reminisced fondly about the friendships he formed in his eight-year NFL career.</p>
			</div>
			<p>At 37, the hope of someday being able to physically sustain a full-time job is just that &mdash; hope.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;When he shuts down, it&rsquo;s like watching a wind-up toy come to the end of its line,&rdquo; says his longtime girlfriend, Bailey. &ldquo;He looks like a strong, healthy, able-bodied person, but you don&rsquo;t see the stuff that goes on behind closed doors.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Yes, the punishment he took on the football field is how Putzier got here, holed up in his Centennial home with a daily to-do list that includes physical therapy or music therapy or light therapy, or all three, and consuming a cocktail of supplements such as fish oil capsules and <a href="http://extras.denverpost.com/cbd-nfl/index.html">cannabidiol</a> that has turned his kitchen cupboard into a mini-GNC.</p>

			<p>Certainly not every former football player experiences the symptoms Putzier does. But with the heightened awareness of the long-term damage football can do to the body, many ex-players, regardless of their condition, are anxiously&nbsp;searching for new ways to not only treat pain but also prevent the onset of additional symptoms.</p>
			<p>The hunt for answers when so much is still unknown about traumatic brain injuries has created a wild west for players unsure where to turn. Specialists in Colorado have joined the quest and could be on the forefront of significant progress.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">Blueprint for recovery</h3>

			<p class="lead">At least twice a month Putzier voluntarily visits his version of hell. Beads of sweat dot his forehead as he slowly makes his way inside the windowless room in the office of Dr. Shane Steadman, a chiropractic neurologist with Integrated Health Systems in Englewood. There is no wall art, and the only furniture is an outsize barber&rsquo;s chair that beckons Putzier with its soft black leather and plush armrests.</p>
			<div class="centerphoto">
				<img src="./img/JEB_16.jpg" alt="Jeb Putzier sits in a chair during a QUUEG session" />
				<p class="caption"><span class="photog">AAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post</span>Jeb Putzier sits in a chair during a QUUEG session at NeuraPerformance. Jeb entered the session without taking his prescriptions in order to get a raw reading of his brain. Rachel Ragsdale or NeuraPerformance said though she does not advise one way or another on the use of prescriptions that, &ldquo;medications have a global impact on the QEEG.&rdquo;</p>
			</div>
			<p>&ldquo;I hate this,&rdquo; he says as a wave of anxiety and nausea rushes over him. &ldquo;I hate this so much.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>As Putzier&nbsp;eases into the chair, Steadman straps a pair of infrared goggles around his head. Putzier&rsquo;s enlarged pupils, bouncing side to side, are projected onto a nearby laptop computer. Faster and faster they bob as the sweat drips down his face and his fingers dig into the leather.</p>
			<p>Putzier says he was diagnosed in April with postconcussion syndrome, attaching a label to myriad symptoms he has dealt with since he retired. Steadman, an expert in functional neurology, is one of many specialists Putzier and other former players see to try to find peace.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The goal is to try to understand the function or, in many of our patients&rsquo; cases, we&rsquo;re trying to understand their dysfunction,&rdquo; says Steadman, who also does full blood and hormonal evaluations to connect the physical symptoms with the neurological causes. &ldquo;(We&rsquo;re) trying to figure out how areas of the brain integrate with other areas of the brain and also how it integrates with the body.&rdquo;</p>

				<h3 class="subheading">Colorado brain imaging company joins quest for research, answers</h3>
				<p class="lead">Extensive news coverage of the dangers of concussions in recent years has led some NFL players to retire early to avoid the possibility of further brain damage. And many retired players have taken steps to not only alleviate their postfootball pain but to try to fight the onset of additional complications.</p>
				<p>But the science behind traumatic brain injury (TBI), and especially chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), is still in its infancy.</p>
				<p><a href="http://cerescan.com/">CereScan</a>, a functional brain imaging and data analytics company in Littleton, is working to change that. Using quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (qSPECT) imaging to measure blood flow in up to 160 regions of the brain, CereScan&rsquo;s technology, combined with clinical assessments and previous imaging, can offer a more complete picture of a patient&rsquo;s brain function than structural images, like MRIs and CT scans, alone can provide.</p>
				<p>Blood flow in the brain, which indicates how cells are working, is diagnosed and displayed on a color spectrum. Blues and greens show areas with less blood flow, and oranges and reds indicate normal or above-average blood flow. The imaging and diagnostic report, which can cost $2,400 to $4,200 per patient, provides a starting point in recommending treatments, be it infrared light therapy, functional neurology, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, neurofeedback or even yoga.</p>
				<p>CereScan stores and catalogues all information in its database, CereMetrix, which now includes about 7,000 scans from patients in 40 states and four countries. In that database are records of dozens of current and former NFL players, Broncos included. CereScan hopes the extensive database will aid practitioners and also advance research of brain injuries and diseases.</p>
				<p>The company, with funding from the <a href="http://www.tugmcgraw.org/">Tug McGraw Foundation</a> and in partnership with the Colorado Neurological Institute, is nearing a completion of a study called <a href="http://cerescan.com/research/traumatic-brain-injury/">The Invisible Brain Injury Project</a> on the effectiveness of near infrared light therapy as treatment for TBI in military veterans and former NFL players.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There are some positive indications emerging from various therapies, and we&rsquo;re as anxious as anyone to help in verifying which offer the most promising results,&rdquo; says John Kelley, CereScan&rsquo;s chairman and CEO. &ldquo;Hyperbaric chamber, yoga, dietary changes, all sorts of things. Sometimes they show good things, sometimes not. But how do you know? We can provide measurements and precise locations of those functional changes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Locally, word has gotten out about CereScan&rsquo;s research. The next step? Getting the NFL and NFL Players Association to buy in. CereScan has had multiple meetings with league and union officials about offering its technology to help active and retired players. But the conversations &mdash; much like the research of TBI &mdash; are just getting started.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The NFL is appropriately skeptical of people bearing gifts,&rdquo; Kelley says. &ldquo;Over time, we&rsquo;re gaining credibility with them. We don&rsquo;t want anything. We&rsquo;re not asking for anything. We&rsquo;re saying look, we&rsquo;re providing technology you guys should be familiar with or take advantage of.&rdquo;</p>

			</section>
			<p>With interactive technologies such as a Neuro Sensorimotor Integrator, Steadman tests Putzier&rsquo;s balance and motor skills. The videonystagmography (VNG) goggles Putzier hate so much record his drifting eyes, offering signs of how his brain is working. Coordinated head-and-eye movements target certain areas of the brain that are underperforming.</p>
			<p>The process seems simple, but within minutes Putzier&rsquo;s long hair is drenched, his face is pale and the energy he entered the office with has disappeared. The light-and-sound stimulation is overwhelming, and recovery can sometimes take as many as 18 hours of rest, he says.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re using measuring tools, we&rsquo;re able to see improvements within a short period of time,&rdquo; Steadman says. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re 100 percent resolved. But we&rsquo;re able to see improvements within a few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Progress for Putzier has been slow and unsteady, but noticeable in terms of his emotional stability, mental endurance and thought processing. But the incremental and often invisible changes in his mind are laid bare in specialized images taken at CereScan, a functional brain imaging and data analytics company in Littleton.</p>
			<p>CereScan uses quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (qSPECT) imaging to show how the brain is functioning. (Putzier began working with the company in 2011 and is now both a patient and a consultant.) Unlike magnetic resonance images (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans that show the structure of the brain, qSPECT scans measure blood flow, which can reveal how cells are working in the brain.</p>
			<p>For Putzier and the dozens of other NFL players and military veterans CereScan has worked with, the images and medical assessments provide not only proof of their cognitive limitations but baselines for treatment, be it near infrared light therapy (NIR), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, neurofeedback, dietary changes or&nbsp;even yoga.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;The industry is coming to the point where the doctors need to know structural and they need to know functional,&rdquo; says CereScan&rsquo;s chairman and CEO, John Kelley. &ldquo;Pictures are great, and the doctors rely on them. But now the brain can be mathematically mapped. So as soon as you put it into digits, now you can put mathematics to it, so the doctors will see almost like a spreadsheet of how an area, up to 160 regions, is performing.&rdquo;</p>

				<img src="./img/JEB_11.jpg" alt="Jeb Putzier lies in bed" />
				<p class="caption"><span class="photog">AAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post</span>Jeb Putzier lies in bed with a light band on his head and headphones on his ears as he does light and music therapy. The light stimulates mitochondria and increases blood flow to areas of the brain that have been low on such things. The sound is said to help in the restoration of neurological cells as the frequency stimulates the brain.</p>
			</div>
			<p>In October 2013, Putzier underwent a qSPECT scan that found numerous regions of his brain lacked the normal amount of blood flow; cool colors dominated many regions, accounting for his cognitive fatigue, unstable mood, light-and-sound sensitivity, balance issues and chronic headaches. Ten months later, many areas of his brain &mdash; specifically in his occipital lobe and cerebellum that were constantly rattled from hits &mdash; lit up in reds and oranges, indicative of greater blood flow.</p>
			<p>The improvement was in part a credit to the weekly work with Steadman, but also the regular sessions of NIR, which Kelley likens to Viagra, but for the brain. Every other day for about 20 minutes at a time, Putzier wraps a foam pad dotted with small bulbs around his head to let the infrared light permeate his skull and shower the surface of his brain to increase blood flow.</p>
			<p>But Putzier continues his hunt for help.</p>
			<p>He has added music therapy to his regimen, often laying in bed with the infrared light device strapped around as his head as steady beats play through his earphones. The stem cell therapy received in May from Premier Stem Cell Institute in Johnstown will ease his joint pain, he hopes, and put&nbsp;off surgery. He recently started neurofeedback at the NeuraPerformance Brain Center in Denver to try to self-regulate and retrain his brain. And, if insurance allows it, he may try Botox, which has been FDA-approved to treat chronic migraines.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Trying to explain to people, it&rsquo;s like we have a rope with knots and we&rsquo;re trying to untie the knots one at a time,&rdquo; Putzier says. &ldquo;But when I untied this knot, it led to other problems in between to the next knot.&rdquo;</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">An unshakable love</h3>

			<p class="lead">Stacked on a mounted metal shelf in the closet in Putzier&rsquo;s basement are nearly 30 commemorative game balls he received during his playing days. Resting on the floor are duffel bags and plastic bins stuffed with autographed jerseys of former teammates. A framed collage of newspaper clippings &mdash; &ldquo;Jeb Putzier&rsquo;s Walk to Stardom&rdquo; &mdash; leans on a nearby wall, ready to be hung. And, in an unfinished room, old photographs and football playing cards from his early days as a Broncos tight end are strewn across a wooden counter. Ask him about the ones in the middle and his face lights up as he tells the stories behind the images of him, Ed McCaffrey, Jake Plummer and Danny Kanell sitting on the Broncos&rsquo; team plane, or the one of him dressed up at a Halloween party.</p>
			<p>The bulk of Putzier&rsquo;s NFL career is proudly scattered in this 1,100-square-foot space. While he vows he would never play if given the chance again, there is no hiding his love for the &ldquo;chess match&rdquo; of football. He still watches NFL games, and for a few years after retiring he parlayed his playing career into one as a radio analyst. But that, too, had to be scaled back and eventually put on hold because of his condition.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;d be frustrating for any person,&rdquo; Bailey says. &ldquo;But for someone who made a career of being a professional athlete and being that big, strong, tough person to not be able to do these things &mdash; there&rsquo;s pride and you don&rsquo;t want to admit that you need help and that you&rsquo;re vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>
			<div class="centerphoto">
				<img src="./img/JEB_08.jpg" alt="Jeb Putzier with mementos from his playing days" />
				<p class="caption"><span class="photog">AAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post</span>Jeb Putzier rummages through a small closet in his basement where he keeps mementos from his playing days. Though in a physical state that has him feeling like he is 75 years old, Putzier reminisced fondly about the friendships he formed in his eight-year NFL career.</p>
			</div>
			<p>His shoulders, pummeled by defenders, became so sore late last year he was unable to lift his kids and help with small projects around the house. His hips took a beating with the constant shifting, cutting upfield and repeated tackles. And his knee pain is a sore reminder of it all.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s part of the price to pay in playing the game,&rdquo; says Mark Schlereth, 50, a former Broncos guard who played 12 NFL seasons and had 29 surgeries. &ldquo;I knew what I was doing to myself. I&rsquo;m not naive. I didn&rsquo;t think, &lsquo;Oh, I had no idea that this is what it was going to feel like.&rsquo; No, I knew. You didn&rsquo;t have to tell me that what I did to myself was abusive. I signed up to do it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Putzier and Bailey remain hopeful that he will recover enough to resume the activities he enjoyed even just four years ago. But as the many treatments slowly try to untangle those knots, the most obvious question &mdash; the one at the heart of players&rsquo; search for solutions &mdash; can&rsquo;t be ignored.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Why do some guys go on to live very functional lives, and some guys, their brains just kind of break down?&rdquo; Schlereth says. &ldquo;I always thought your body is such an unbelievable compensation machine. Why do some guys seem to be able to overcome and other guys can&rsquo;t? I&rsquo;ve always felt like there&rsquo;s some genetic predisposition.&rdquo;</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">Fear of the future</h3>

			<p class="lead">Dr. Sherrie Ballantine-Talmadge, a physician and pain-management specialist at the University of Colorado&rsquo;s Sports Medicine and Performance Center in Boulder, has an adage she shares often with colleagues but admits is rarely said outside her clinic&rsquo;s doors.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Once you&rsquo;ve seen one concussion, you&rsquo;ve seen one concussion,&rdquo; she explains, &ldquo;meaning each concussion is different and each concussion within each person is different.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>That, in part, is perhaps why Putzier is a self-described shell of himself and Hall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon, who played 23 years of pro ball, has the mind and the body of a man much younger.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I had six concussions, and I don&rsquo;t know how many more times where I was dinged in the head, where I kind of lost my faculties for a few seconds and was able to get everything back and stayed in the game,&rdquo; says Moon, 59.</p>
			<div class="centerphoto">
				<img src="./img/JEB_08.jpg" alt="Putzier struggles to remember how to play a song on his guitar" />
				<p class="caption"><span class="photog">AAron Ontiveroz, The Denver Post</span>Jeb Putzier struggles to remember how to play a song on his guitar despite knowing it by heart. The former NFL tight end, who estimates that he suffered more than 1,000 concussions during his time playing football, said that some days he can play a song flawlessly with lyrics, but other days cannot even get through the first few chords.</p>
			</div>
			<p>The public discourse regarding football-related injuries is louder now than ever, but far more is unknown about traumatic brain injuries than known.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awareness problem,&rdquo; says Dr. Geoffrey T. Manley, a professor and vice chairman of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco. &ldquo;I see us in the very early days of this. With brain injury in general, we&rsquo;re at least 20, 30 years behind cancer and heart disease.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Which is why Moon and some other retired players feel fortunate but anxious &mdash; anxious about when the symptoms may hit them.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Physically I feel really good, but I worry every day when are some signs going to show from concussions and head injuries that I did have in my career,&rdquo; says Moon, who plans to donate his brain to research for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). &ldquo;You live every day wondering if this is ever going to creep into your body, just because you&rsquo;re seeing so many of your peers who are around the same age struggling with this type of stuff.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>When Moon retired, he received a complete physical assessment in Seattle to determine any physical deficiencies to help him manage his minimal pain and ward off the cognitive symptoms he so fears.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Football takes a tremendous toll on your body, and you don&rsquo;t really realize it until you&rsquo;re actually done,&rdquo; Moon says. &ldquo;Once you get away from it, you start to feel those effects.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Tyler Polumbus felt it. He felt it before he got away from the game.</p>
			<p>The former Broncos offensive tackle retired in April after an MRI showed a herniated disc in his neck that has been causing a shooting pain down his left arm. The images also showed four degenerated discs in his lower back that caused significant pain last season. Surgery on those probably isn&rsquo;t an option, he says.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We all think we&rsquo;re invincible,&rdquo; says Polumbus, 31. &ldquo;It never once hit my mind until that the concussion stuff, and that was the first time I was really like, &lsquo;All right, I need to be careful here.&rsquo; And even then, you never think you&rsquo;re going to be one of the stats. Now that I&rsquo;m retired and I&rsquo;m actually seeing the MRIs and I&rsquo;m actually seeing the causes of why I&rsquo;m in pain, it makes me more concerned that while I was playing I just thought it was bumps and bruises.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Polumbus now counts himself among the fortunate but cautious. In the past three months he has shed nearly 40 pounds through diet and exercise, in part, he says jokingly, to stave&nbsp;off calls that may lure him back to the field. His only surgeries (on shoulders) came in college, and he was reported to have only two concussions in his NFL career, both in 2012 while he was with Washington. But he has dealt with a persistent headache ever since.</p>
			<p>The aura of invincibility and the high pain threshold that helped him get to the NFL and last eight seasons are&nbsp;now causing him to be nervous about the unknown.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;A little bit,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;Honestly, that&rsquo;s my worst problem right now. I&rsquo;ve just been living in pain for so long, I thought it was normal. Now that I realize that I&rsquo;ve got that many (degenerated) discs, I&rsquo;m more worried about it than I was.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Soon, Polumbus will travel to New Orleans for a complete <a href="http://tulane.edu/som/trust-tism/">brain and body assessment</a> at Tulane University, coordinated by The Trust, an organization established by the NFL Players Association to support former players. He hopes the examinations, combined with the MRI he received, will give him a solid framework to build a treatment plan &mdash; much as the qSPECT images gave Putzier a blueprint for recovery.</p>
			<p>Because, like Putzier and Moon and many other retired players, Polumbus knows how he got here. And he, too, is hunting for answers.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crippled by any means, but it&rsquo;s significant pain,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;Honestly, it&rsquo;s one of those things I never know &mdash; our pain threshold is so different from other people that I always wonder, should I be living with this? I&rsquo;m concerned about it, so I&rsquo;m trying to be proactive about it.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Throughout his 10-year career as an NFL quarterback, Plummer was cognizant of the physical and mental pain he was inflicting on himself. As much as he tried to avoid painkillers, there were times when he needed the assistance.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;There were guys in college that were taking Percocets all the time and drinking beers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was rampant. I had done that a few times, but the effects afterward, the day after, just the feeling I had, I hated it. It made me feel detached. In 10 years (in the NFL), I took maybe 20, where I could come out of a game and be like, &lsquo;I need to make this flight home, because it hurts like hell just sitting here.&rsquo; But if I had had (CBD), I would much rather have done that.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Others would too.</p>
			<p>Former Broncos tight end Nate Jackson has spoken candidly of the abuse his body took playing football. Torn ligaments. Torn muscles. Broken bones. Chipped bones. Separated shoulders. A dislocated shoulder. Misaligned clavicles. Lower spine trauma. Brain trauma. And more.</p>

				<h3 class="subheading">First family of CBD</h3>
				<p class="lead">The Stanley brothers &mdash; Joel, Jon, Jordan, Jesse, and Jared &mdash; entered the marijuana industry in 2008 in Denver. They began to grow a strain that  helped put CBD on the map in 2013, when CNN documented the plight of 5-year-old Charlotte Figi, who had a  rare and severe form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome. Figi  suffered hundreds of grand mal seizures a week. When medical treatments failed, Figi&rsquo;s parents took a gamble on cannabis.</p>
				<p>The Stanley brothers&rsquo; high-CBD, low-THC strain of cannabis that was infused in oil helped to significantly reduce the number of  Figi&rsquo;s seizures. The product, which drew a waiting list of families seeking the same results for their children, later became known as Charlotte&rsquo;s Web.</p>
				<p>The Stanley brothers founded CW Botanicals and a nonprofit, the Realm of Caring, which helps families afford cannabinoid treatment.</p>
				<p>Over the years, CW has grown from a small family-owned upstart to a  global operation with  dozens of employees and multiple greenhouses and dispensaries scattered across Colorado. Millions of dollars in technology, and teams for quality control and research and development, are housed in its new Boulder lab alone.</p>
			</section>
			<p>He was the first player to get involved with the Bright Lights campaign, joining <a href="http://www.cwbotanicals.com/">CW Botanicals</a> and the <a href="https://www.theroc.us/">Realm of Caring</a>, its non-profit partner for cannabinoid advocacy and education. He did it not because he wants NFL locker rooms to become smoke-filled retreats with trainers handing out joints. He simply wants players to have options &mdash; effective but safer options than the prescription painkillers <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2013/09/slow_getting_up_excerpt_nate_jackson_explains_why_he_took_hgh_at_the_end.html">and illegal drugs he admittedly used</a> in desperation when he played.</p>
			<p>CBD, he believes, is one.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take Vicodin or Percocet before practices or games,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;It was not something that I wanted to try because football is too much. It&rsquo;s too violent. You got 11 guys coming to take your head off, so I didn&rsquo;t want to chance it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Pills and injections are the norm in football, and the long-term health concerns are great. Players have often cited the unwelcome side effects &mdash; lethargy, depression, stomach pain, the risk of addiction &mdash; and some have chosen to self-medicate instead, often with marijuana.</p>
			<p>Last summer, Plummer added CBD to his regimen. He ingests the oil and rubs the gel on his wrists and back. He doesn&rsquo;t get high, but he is able to play two to three games of handball with &ldquo;the young cats.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve used every tincture and fad known to man that comes through to claim pain relief,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This one really does give me some relief in the area of discomfort.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Anecdotal evidence and preclinical research, often on animals, suggest CBD is effective in treating neuropathic pain and inflammation without getting users high; tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.</p>

				<h3 class="subheading">About cannabidiol</h3>
				<p>Cannabidiol, or CBD, is one of nearly 100 cannabinoids in cannabis that is believed to have many medical benefits without getting users high. Studies and anecdotal evidence have found CBD helps people cope with the following diseases and symptoms, among others:</p>

					<li>Inflammation</li>
					<li>Neuropathic pain</li>
					<li>Anxiety</li>
					<li>Depression</li>
					<li>Seizures</li>
					<li>Addiction</li>
					<li>Alzheimer’s/dementia</li>
					<li>Nausea</li>
					<li>Glaucoma</li>
					<li>Insomnia</li>
					<li>Arthritis</li>
				</ul>

			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about something with a safety profile that looks like vitamin C, but because it comes out of the controversial world of cannabis, people immediately associate it with a dangerous drug,&rdquo; said Joel Stanley, the CEO of CW Botanicals. &ldquo;Nothing could be farther from the truth.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>CW&rsquo;s product, called Charlotte&rsquo;s Web, is made from hemp, distinct from marijuana and legally defined as having no more than 0.3 percent THC. It&rsquo;s believed that no player could consume enough of the product to cross the NFL&rsquo;s allowable limit of 35 nanograms of activated THC per milliliter of urine. But any amount poses a risk.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;These guys, if they want to just take care of their bodies, they can&rsquo;t out of fear that they would test positive,&rdquo; said Ryan Kingsbury, CW&rsquo;s chief communications officer. &ldquo;If they test under it, it&rsquo;s not a big deal. I&rsquo;m confident it won&rsquo;t, but I don&rsquo;t want to tell a guy who has a multi-million-dollar deal that it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Kingsbury estimates at least 30 active and retired players use some form of CBD from CW Botanicals, with the former group clearly believing the rewards outweigh any risks.</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">Painful lifestyle</h3>

			<p>As more states &mdash; up to 24 now, plus the District of Columbia &mdash; have legalized medical marijuana, calls for the NFL to change its substance-abuse policy have grown louder.</p>
			<p>The league and the players association, which both declined to grant interviews for this story, agreed to alter the policy in 2014 and raise the THC threshold from 15 ng/ml to 35 ng/ml. Players are tested only once in the offseason, but violators are entered into an intervention program that calls for additional random tests and penalties that range from fines to one-year suspensions without pay.</p>

			</div>
			<p>In the context of a 16-game season, the penalties are severe.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Do you ever hear of any other professional athletes getting popped for weed other than in football? You never do,&rdquo; said Jackson, who estimates at least 50 percent of NFL players use some form of marijuana. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not happening anywhere but in the NFL, and it&rsquo;s funny because the NFL is really the one sport that needs it most. (Players) use it because they need it, and it&rsquo;s not stopping them from being the very best at what they do. Why are we punishing them for it?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Plummer said change can&rsquo;t be demanded without more science, so part of the Bright Lights&rsquo; initial studies will focus on how much CBD a player can consume without testing hot.</p>
			<p>But the &ldquo;what ifs?&rdquo; are there: What if the NFL simply raised its THC limit to ensure those taking hemp-based CBD products wouldn&rsquo;t fail a test? What if CBD could be prescribed by team trainers via a therapeutic-use exemption?</p>
			<p>After all, that exemption is how former offensive lineman Eben Britton was allowed to take <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_24055922/nfl-other-leagues-deal-players-use-amphetamine-adderall">Adderall</a>, a medication that helped with pain from injuries but took him on an emotional roller coaster. In 2013, his first year with the Chicago Bears, Britton suffered a torn muscle on the bottom of his right foot. He still has no feeling in that foot. His shoulder was dislocated. And by the end of every season, he would have to wear casts on his thumbs and now has arthritis in his fingers. He has pain in nearly every joint.</p>

				<p class="lead">A look at how the  NFL&rsquo;s THC limit and disciplinary system compares to those of other professional leagues and organizations:</p>

				<p><strong>NFL: <a href="https://nflpaweb.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/PDFs/Player%20Development/2015%20Policy%20and%20Program%20on%20Substances%20of%20Abuse.pdf">35 ng/ml THC</a></strong><br />
				Players are tested once in the offseason. The first violation enters the  player into an intervention program. Penalties for further violations: two-game fine, four-game fine, four-game suspension, 10-game suspension, one-year ban.</p>
				<p><strong>NBA: <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/172760974/NBA-NBPA-CBA-2011">15 ng/ml</a></strong><br />
				Players face random tests up to four times a season (no marijuana testing in offseason). First violation and/or reasonable cause enters the player into program. Second violation: $25,000 fine. Third: Five-game ban. Subsequent violations: Five games longer than previous suspension.</p>
				<p><strong>MLB: <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/pa/pdf/jda.pdf">50 ng/ml</a></strong><br />
				Players tested only if league or union finds reasonable cause. Noncompliance with treatment plan warrants fines, not to exceed $35,000. Player suspended only if he &ldquo;flagrantly disregarded&rdquo; rules or if commissioner deems him a threat to others players&rsquo; safety.</p>
				<p><strong>NHL</strong><br />
				Marijuana is not on the list of banned substances. Players are tested for drugs of abuse, but only to monitor use. League and  union will reach out to player for help after multiple failed tests, but no policy for discipline.</p>
				<p><strong>Olympics (World Anti-Doping Agency): <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2013-05/new-threshold-level-for-cannabis">150 ng/ml</a></strong><br />
				Violators face suspensions ranging from three months to one year.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Every guy on the team is a prescribed a bottle of anti-inflammatories of one kind or another, whether it&rsquo;s Cataflam, Indocin, Aleve, Tylenol, Advil. Every guy is taking that (stuff) every single day,&rdquo; Britton said.</p>
			<p>Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Eugene Monroe saw up close how much Britton struggled when they were teammates with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He remembers the play that <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5727094">blew out Britton&rsquo;s shoulder</a> at Kansas City, and he remembers when Britton walked around Jaguars headquarters with an IV drip for eight weeks after contracting an infection following back surgery.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find these stories across every locker room in the NFL,&rdquo; Monroe said. &ldquo;When you talk to someone&rsquo;s family members, if you talk to a player&rsquo;s wife, I guarantee you she&rsquo;d be able to paint a vivid picture for the struggles that her husband goes through on a daily basis. I&rsquo;m talking about out of season too, because injuries don&rsquo;t magically go away.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Monroe, the only active player involved in the campaign, said he has never used marijuana or CBD. He donated $10,000 to the cause, but he can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t risk failing a drug test.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to read how beneficial CBD is and not be able to take it, knowing that all of the symptoms that I&rsquo;m experiencing as an athlete could potentially, or will be, remedied because it&rsquo;s happened over and over again for people all over our country,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason for the NFL or other sports to test their players and punish them for consuming a substance that is benefiting them.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>Mark Schlereth, a former Broncos guard who is an NFL analyst on radio and TV, never used marijuana or CBD while playing &mdash; and still doesn&rsquo;t. He never smoked or drank alcohol. He took team-prescribed painkillers when needed, but only when needed.</p>
			<p>He left the NFL in 2001 with three Super Bowl title rings, a body that was relatively intact despite numerous surgeries and a lucrative second career awaiting him, at ESPN.</p>
			<p>But he hasn&rsquo;t been pain-free for a long time.</p>
			<div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns inset-video-left">

				<p class="caption"><span class="photog">Denver Post file photo</span>Former Broncos guard Mark Schlereth warms up at the start of practice at team headquarters in 2000.</p>
			</div>
			<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t known anything but pain from the time I was 18 years old,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wake up 10 times a night because my shoulder hurts or my back hurts or my knee is bothering me. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to lay my head on a pillow at night and wake up the next morning without waking up eight to 10 times. That&rsquo;s normal to me. And I think most guys find whatever normal is and you just kind of adjust to it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Schlereth said the NFL became more regulated in how it administered prescription painkillers about midway through his 12-year career. But rules alone haven&rsquo;t spared addiction.</p>
			<p>In 2014, a record 47,055 deaths from drug overdoses occurred in the U.S., and opioids were involved in a record 28,647 (61 percent) of those, according to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6450a3.htm">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Vicodin, Percocet, morphine, codeine &mdash; drugs often given to NFL players to relieve pain &mdash; are part of a nationwide epidemic.</p>
			<p>Players often are in a Catch-22: They need the drugs to stay on the field and to stay on the team. But in taking them, they run a high risk of becoming addicted and further destroying their long-term health.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Guys abuse opiates and painkillers and everything else,&rdquo; Schlereth said. &ldquo;So if there&rsquo;s compelling research that says (CBD) is helpful, I don&rsquo;t know why the NFL wouldn&rsquo;t want to help players.&rdquo;</p>
			<section class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns inset right">
				<h3 class="subheading">Contradiction part of marijuana assessment</h3>
				<p class="lead">CBD sits in a legal gray zone.</p>
				<p>Per the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is a Schedule I drug, a classification for substances such as  heroin and LSD that are deemed to have no medicinal value and are a high risk for abuse. Although hemp is from the same plant species as marijuana, it is defined as cannabis with no more than 0.3 percent THC and is afforded legal protections that producers say allow them to sell and ship their products to all 50 states.</p>
				<p>But the crossover has led to contradiction.</p>
				<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has a patent, &ldquo;Cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants,&rdquo; that says compounds in cannabis are useful in treating neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, as well as inflammation. What&rsquo;s more: Synthetic THC is a Schedule III drug that doctors can prescribe.</p>
				<p>The murky legal status of cannabis has hindered clinical research on CBD and given physicians pause in recommending it.</p>
				<p>&quot;I think the issue a lot of us have with some of the marijuana derivatives is we still don&rsquo;t know the long-term neurological consequences,&rdquo; said Dr. Rachel Brakke-Homan, who specializes in non-invasive pain management and spinal injuries at Colorado&rsquo;s Sports Medicine and Performance Center. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m very cautious with those medications and I really don&rsquo;t recommend them. &hellip; I tend to focus on all of the other treatments first, just because there is more evidence.&rdquo;</p>
			</section>
			<p>A 2011 study by researchers at <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3095672/">Washington University in St. Louis</a> and commissioned by ESPN found that 52 percent of retired NFL players used opioids during their career and 71 percent of those reported abuse.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely for someone to die of a cannabis overdose, let alone nonpsychoactive CBD.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Opioids can cause a fatal overdose &mdash; morphine, heroin, oxycodone &mdash; because if you take too much, those molecules bind to the receptors in the brainstem and prevent you from breathing,&rdquo; said Dr. David Casarett, a physician and researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of &ldquo;Stoned.&rdquo; &ldquo;But since there are no cannabinoid receptors in the brainstem, marijuana won&rsquo;t. You could certainly have a really interesting couple of hours &mdash; hallucinations, paranoid delusions, the whole bit &mdash; but you won&rsquo;t die because of an overdose.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Several studies have found CBD even counteracts the psychoactive effects of THC and could be <a href="https://www.theroc.us/images/Cannabidiol%20as%20an%20Intervention%20for%20Addictive%20Behaviors-%20A%20Systematic%20Review%20of%20the%20Evidence.pdf">beneficial in treating some addictions</a>.</p>
			<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t mean it works for all. And it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s free of side effects. Any long-term ones are unknown.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t stake my entire reputation on saying that it works, but there are a lot of researchers who think that of all the ingredients in marijuana, it might be CBD that has much or even more of an effect on that neuropathic pain than THC does,&rdquo; Casarett said. &ldquo;As far as I know, there really haven&rsquo;t been studies on brain trauma except for some very preliminary laboratory studies &mdash; studies that cannabinoids may be protective after strokes induced in mice in the laboratory. That&rsquo;s a huge leap to say there&rsquo;s cellular evidence of neuroprotection in a mouse in a laboratory, so we should start giving it to football players.&rdquo;</p>

			<h3 class="subheading">Looking ahead</h3>

			<p>Plummer was a rarity in his day. While countless players are forced out of football by injury, he voluntarily left the NFL at age 32.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I was lucky,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to have a bad (injury) at that point in my life and my career. I don&rsquo;t think I could have made it through it.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In recent years, players have begun to look ahead, just as Plummer did nine years ago, primarily because of an increased focus on concussions and subsequent brain damage.</p>

			</div>
			<p>Just over a year ago, San Francisco 49ers linebacker <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_27727302/49ers-chris-borland-retiring-at-24-wary-head-trauma">Chris Borland retired after only one season at age 24</a> because of head injuries. Green Bay Packers rookie wide receiver Adrian Coxson <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13602937/former-green-bay-packers-player-adrian-coxson-retiring-says-next-hit-kill-me">called it quits</a> six months later having never played in a regular-season game because he feared one more hit could &ldquo;possibly kill me or be life-damaging.&rdquo; (A month earlier, he had been taken off the practice field by an ambulance with a Grade 3 concussion.) And this month, Buffalo Bills linebacker <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/mmqb/2016/04/12/nfl-aj-tarpley-buffalo-bills-retirement">A.J. Tarpley announced his retirement</a> at age 23 after playing only one season in the NFL, also citing concussions.</p>
			<p>Talk of brain injuries and CTE has reached a fever pitch in the NFL, but research and knowledge of the disease still is in its infancy. The same holds true for CBD, only funding for its research pales in comparison. The players involved in the Bright Lights campaign hope the early studies that are funded will spur a larger clinical examination of CBD&rsquo;s effectiveness in treating not just injuries but also symptoms of concussions and CTE.</p>
			<p>Plummer hopes he and his fellow players will soon be armed with enough clinical proof of CBD&rsquo;s benefits to initiate a conversation with NFL officials. And he really hopes for change &mdash; change that will help other players be able to hit the courts with the &ldquo;young cats&rdquo; &rsquo;til they&rsquo;re stiff. Maybe go two or three games.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping (NFL officials) talk to us about it if they really, truly care about the players and their health and well-being &mdash; not just while they&rsquo;re making millions of dollars from the NFL, but when they&rsquo;re done and when they&rsquo;ve moved on,&rdquo; Plummer said. &ldquo;Joe Montana <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2016/02/04/joe-montana-pain-physical-ailment/79852754/">can&rsquo;t live an active lifestyle</a>, Jim McMahon has headaches all the time and is in pain. These are the legends who prance out at halftime during the 50th Super Bowl, and they&rsquo;re suffering. People don&rsquo;t know that, but when they read about it and see it, that&rsquo;s when I hope there&rsquo;s action taken.&rdquo;</p>
